==========


In this problem set we're going to write a couple of basic CS50 C programs in Java.

First and foremost:

* Watch the [LaunchCodeTV Java series](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java-on-the-command-line?lesson=Java) to help get your environment setup.
* Purchase the book ["Clean Code" by Robert Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
* Create the "Mario" application (described in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z32BxNe2Sfc)) using Java instead of C
* Watch this [video on Java Strings](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_strings?lesson=Java) and this [video on Java String Performance](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_strings_performance?lesson=Java)
* When your code is complete, create a new GitHub repository, commit your code locally, and push your code to your new GitHub repo.  Here's a [video on how](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/github?lesson=Git).  Also be sure to add a [.gitignore file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) so that you only commit appropriate files.
* If you're on windows, I highly recommend using Cygwin as your terminal.  It lets you work from a Unix prompt which is used throughout the videos.  Be sure to install the git package on install  [Download Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/install.html)
* When you're done, send me an email by using the email address on my [Profile Page](https://github.com/MoMenne)

Creating Mario using Java will help you get used to the Java syntax as well as familiarize yourself with loops and Strings.
