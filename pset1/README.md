PSET 1
==========


In this problem set we're going to write a couple of basic CS50 C programs in Java.

First and foremost:

* Watch the [LaunchCodeTV Java series](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java-on-the-command-line?lesson=Java) to help get your environment setup.
* Purcase the book ["Clean Code" by Robert Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
* Create the "Mario" application using Java instead of C
* If you used arrays in Step 3, now try and create Mario using Java Collections.
* When it is complete commit the project as a new repository to Github.
