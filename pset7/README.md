(Not so secret) Hidden Java Magic
=========================================

There are parts Java that are hidden from the naked eye of the developer.  The won't be any apparent source code to explain how this code does what it does.  

*How can I use annotations to write less code that does the same amount of stuff?*

*How does equals and hashcode have such a significant impact on the execution of your program?*


### How to understand Java Annotations
0)  Just for fun watch this [video on arrays and java collections](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_arrays_vs_collections?lesson=Java) and this [video on Java generics](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_generics?lesson=Java).  These don't pertain to annotations much... I just didn't have anywhere else to put them :-)

1)  Watch this [video on transitioning from Spring XML configuration to Spring annotations](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_spring_annotations?lesson=Java) then watch [this video about the magic behind annotations](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_annotations?lesson=Java)

2)  Watch this [video on using Hibernate framework with annotations as opposed to JDBC](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_hibernate?lesson=Java).  Then watch this [video on Hibernate primary keys](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_hibernate_primary_key?lesson=Java).  This [video on Log4j](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_log4j?lesson=Java) might help diagnose any Hibernate issues that come up.  Hibernate has pretty specific versions of its libraries.  Watch [video on NoSuchMethodErrors](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_nosuchmethod?lesson=Java) just in case you get in a pinch.   

### Understand a bit about Java Object Collections

1)  Watch this [video on the equals method](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_equals?lesson=Java) and this [video on hashcode method](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_hashcode?lesson=Java) 


Last PSET coming up next!  Great Work.
