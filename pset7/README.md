(Not so secret) Hidden Java Magic
=========================================

There are parts Java that are hidden from the naked eye of the developer.  The won't be any apparent source code to explain how this code does what it does.  

*How does putting @Test run your program as test suite with no main method?*

*How does equals and hashcode have such a significant impact on the execution of your program?*

Answering these types of questions will give great insight into how Java Frameworks like Spring, Junit, and Hiberante function.

### How to understand Java Annotations
0)  Just for fun watch this [video on arrays and java collections](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_arrays_vs_collections?lesson=Java) and this [video on Java generics](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_generics?lesson=Java).  These don't pertain to annotations much... I just didn't have anywhere else to put them :-)

1)  Watch this [video on LaunchCodeTV](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_spring_annotations?lesson=Java) explaining to transition from Spring XML configurations to annotation based configurations.

2)  Do this simple exercise making your Java Annotation ... coming soon

3)  Use the Hibernate ORM instead of JDBC and of course use annotations ... video coming soon

### Understand Java Object Collections

1)  Watch this [video on the equals method](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_equals?lesson=Java) and this [video on hashcode method](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_hashcode?lesson=Java) 

2)  Update your Hibernate objects to use correct equals and hashcode

Last PSET coming up next!  Great Work.
