In this problem set you're going to expand the functionality that you wrote in your Mario java program.

Your goal is to offer the user the option of printing Mario to the console OR to a text file.

What to do:

* Tag your most recent commit, create a branch, and put your new changes on the branch that you just created.  Here's a [description of Git tagging](http://github.com/MoMenne/launchcode-java-class/blob/master/pset2/TaggingHowTo.md) from @sehqlr.  Here's a [video on branching](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/git-branching?lesson=Git).
* Refactor your existing Mario to use proper Java packages.  Open your project in an IDE (preferably Intellij IDEA)
* Check out the following video on how to create a [Java project in under 4 minutes](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_game_10min?lesson=Java) 
* Implement the functionality mentioned in the summary.  When complete, commit and push to your repository.
* Watch the following videos on how to handle exceptions in your code [exception basics](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_exceptions?lesson=Java), [what everyone should know about exceptions](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_exceptions_must_know?lesson=Java), and [the new Java 7 way of handling exceptions](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_try_with_resources?lesson=Java)
* You should notice that your code has lots of if statements... we're going to get rid of those by using the Strategy Design Pattern
* Watch the video [Strategy Design Pattern in Java](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_strategy?lesson=Java)
* Use the Strategy Design Pattern to make your code clean and awesome. 
* If you finish your program and you HAVEN'T used an interface.  Read this [article](http://java.dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-strategy)
* When you're done, send me an email by using the email address on my [Profile Page](https://github.com/MoMenne)
